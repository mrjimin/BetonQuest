# How to create a party quest

Party quests are useful when nearby players should start, play, and complete the same quest together.
BetonQuest parties are not permanent groups.
Instead, a party is created at the moment an action or condition checks for nearby players that match your conditions.

The following example creates a small dungeon party quest.
Players first mark themselves as ready.
When at least two ready players stand close together, one player can start the quest for everyone nearby.
When any active party member defeats the boss, all nearby active party members receive the reward and the quest is cleaned up.

The goal is:

- Players opt into the party quest with a tag.
- The quest only starts if at least two ready players are nearby.
- Starting the quest affects all ready players in range.
- Each party member gets the same boss objective.
- When one member defeats the boss, the whole nearby party is rewarded.
- Temporary tags and objectives are removed after completion.

```yaml
objectives:
  defeatPartyBoss: "mobkill BLAZE 1 notify actions:finishPartyQuest" #(1)!

actions:
  joinPartyQuest: "folder addReadyTag,notifyReady" #(2)!
  addReadyTag: "tag add party_quest_ready"
  notifyReady: "notify &aYou are ready for the party quest. Gather near the dungeon entrance."

  leavePartyQuest: "folder removeReadyTag,removeActiveTag,removeBossObjective,notifyLeft" #(3)!
  removeReadyTag: "tag delete party_quest_ready"
  removeActiveTag: "tag delete party_quest_active"
  removeBossObjective: "objective delete defeatPartyBoss"
  notifyLeft: "notify &cYou left the party quest."

  tryStartPartyQuest: "folder startPartyQuest,notEnoughPlayers" #(4)!
  startPartyQuest: "folder startPartyForNearbyPlayers conditions:enoughReadyPlayers" #(5)!
  notEnoughPlayers: "folder notifyNotEnoughPlayers conditions:!enoughReadyPlayers"
  notifyNotEnoughPlayers: "notify &cAt least two ready players must stand near you."

  startPartyForNearbyPlayers: "party 20 readyForPartyQuest startPartyMember" #(6)!
  startPartyMember: "folder removeReadyTag,addActiveTag,addBossObjective,notifyStarted"
  addActiveTag: "tag add party_quest_active"
  addBossObjective: "objective add defeatPartyBoss"
  notifyStarted: "notify &6Your party quest started. Defeat the blaze together!"

  finishPartyQuest: "party 30 activePartyQuest completePartyMember" #(7)!
  completePartyMember: "folder rewardPlayer,cleanupPartyMember,notifyCompleted"
  rewardPlayer: "give partyReward:3"
  cleanupPartyMember: "folder removeReadyTag,removeActiveTag,removeBossObjective"
  notifyCompleted: "notify &aYour party defeated the boss!"

conditions:
  readyForPartyQuest: "tag party_quest_ready" #(8)!
  activePartyQuest: "tag party_quest_active" #(9)!
  enoughReadyPlayers: "party 20 readyForPartyQuest count:2" #(10)!

items:
  partyReward: "simple EMERALD"
```

1. Every party member receives this objective when the quest starts.
2. This action can be called from a conversation, menu, command objective, or NPC interaction to let a player join the party queue.
3. This optional action lets a player leave the party quest and removes temporary progress from that player.
4. Call this action from a conversation, menu, command objective, or NPC interaction when a player wants to start the party quest.
5. Starts the quest only when the party condition is met. Otherwise, `notEnoughPlayers` sends feedback to the player who tried to start it.
6. Runs `startPartyMember` for every ready player within 20 blocks of the player who started the quest.
7. When any active party member kills the boss, all active party members within 30 blocks receive the completion actions.
8. Only players with this tag are considered ready party members.
9. Only players with this tag can be rewarded when the boss is defeated.
10. Requires at least two ready players within 20 blocks before the quest can start.

The important part is that the party is defined by range and conditions.
Players do not need to create a party with commands.
If they stand close enough and match `readyForPartyQuest` or `activePartyQuest`, the `party` action includes them automatically.
